Intuition:
The hash map approach is similar to the hash set approach but also keeps track of the count of occurrences for each element.
It uses a hash map to store the elements as keys and their counts as values.
If a duplicate element is encountered (count greater than or equal to 1), it returns true.
This approach provides more information than just the presence of duplicates and has a time complexity of O(n).

Explanation:
In this approach, we iterate through the array and store each element as a key in a hash map.
The value associated with each key represents the count of occurrences of that element.
If we encounter an element that already exists in the hash map with a count greater than or equal to 1, we return true, indicating that a duplicate has been found.
Otherwise, we update the count of that element in the hash map.
If we complete the iteration without finding any duplicates, we return false.
