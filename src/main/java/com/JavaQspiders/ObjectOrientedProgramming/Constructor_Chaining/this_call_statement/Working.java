    - Inside constructor body this_call_statement should be the first instruction
        (once that particular this call statement is executed, then only the next line will execute in body of constructor).
    - Whenever this_call_statement added Load_Instruction will be removed.
    - if there is N constructor and maximum we can use N-1 this call statement for it.
