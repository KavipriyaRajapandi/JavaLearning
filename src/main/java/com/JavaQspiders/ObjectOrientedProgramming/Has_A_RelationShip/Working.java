    Relationship: The connection between the objects is called as Relationship
    Types of Relation
    Has_a_relationship (Dependency Relationship)
    Is_a_relationship (Parent child relationship)

    Has_a_Relationship
    Definition:
    The dependency between the objects is called Has_a_Relationship

    HAS_A_RELATIONSHIP has 2 TYPES
    i) Composition (Strong Dependency) - Strong dependency between objects (One object cannot exist without another Object)
    ii)Aggregation (Weak Dependency) - Weak Dependency between objects (One object can exist without another Object)

    How can we achieve Composition ?
     By doing Early instantiation

     What is Early instantiation ?
     Process of creating dependent object inside another object and initializing the object in same line
     code : for composition in relationShip folder

     How can we achieve Aggregation ?
     By doing Lazy Instantiation

     What is Lazy Instantiation ?
     Process of Initializing the dependent object with help of method is called Lazy instantiation
